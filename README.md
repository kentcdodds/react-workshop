## Thank you!

- [Create React App][create-react-app].
- [Matt Zabriskie][matt] for his [react-workshop][original-repo] upon which this one is based.
- [KADIRA][kadira] for their [react-storybook][storybook]

## Setup

You need to have the latest [`node`][node], [`yarn`][yarn], and [`git`][git] installed. Then run:

```
git clone https://github.com/kentcdodds/react-workshop.git
cd react-workshop
yarn run setup
```

### Note on yarn

If you don't have `yarn` installed and don't want to use it for some reason, you can use [`npm`][npm] as well. Instead
of `yarn run setup`, run `node ./scripts/install && npm run validate` and enjoy waiting (and hopefully things don't
break for you). May be a good idea to still run `node ./scripts/verify` to verify you have the right version of other
things too.

### All set up!

If you didn't get any errors running the setup scripts, you're ready to start the workshop! üéâ üéä

If you want to explore a bit, there are a few things you can do:

1. go ahead and open `intro/exercises-final/01-js.html` in a browser (don't peak at the solution!). It should say `Hello World`. Go ahead and open the others if you like.
2. Then you can run `yarn run storybook` and open `http://localhost:9009` and poke around the storybook for our exercises :)
3. Then you could run the app with `yarn start`. This should pop open a window with a stopwatch which we'll be building.

### Any errors?

If you see any errors, read the output and try to follow any instructions. If that doesn't work, feel free to
[file an issue][issues] to ask for help and I'll help if I can. Good luck!
